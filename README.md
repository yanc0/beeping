BeePing is a distant http check as a Service. Call the very simple API, BeePing
will measure website for you.

:us::green_heart: 200 OK - 119 ms

:book: DNS - 9 ms

:arrows_counterclockwise: TCP - 6 ms

:lock: TLS - 52 ms

:desktop_computer: Server Processing - 43 ms

:arrow_down_small: Transfer - 6 ms

Features:

* Very simple JSON API
* Lot of metrics
* Timeline of HTTP request
* SSL Expiration check
* Pattern check (search for text in response)
* GeoIP resolution
* Single binary

Big hugs to :

* Dave Cheney for his inspirational work on [httpstat](https://github.com/davecheney/httpstat)
* Taichi Nakashima for his work on httpstat lib [go-httpstat](https://github.com/tcnksm/go-httpstat)

## Install

Download latest version on [releases page](https://github.com/yanc0/beeping/releases)

- `chmod +x beeping`
- `sudo mv beeping /usr/bin`
- `beeping`

```
$ ./beeping -h
Usage of ./beeping:
  -geodatfile string
    	geoIP database path (default "/opt/GeoIP/GeoLite2-City.mmdb")
  -instance string
    	beeping instance name (default hostname)
```

beeping listens on 8080, if no GeoIP database is found, BeePing omit geo response silently

### Optional

You can plug MaxMind GeoIP file to know on which country the pings goes.

See: http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/

## Build
```shell
go get -u github.com/golang/dep
go get -u github.com/yanc0/beeping
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/yanc0/beeping
dep ensure
go build
```

## API Usage

```
$ curl -XPOST http://localhost:8080/check -d '{"url": "https://google.fr", "pattern": "find me", "insecure": false, "timeout": 20}
{
  "http_status": "200 OK",
  "http_status_code": 200,
  "http_body_pattern": true,
  "http_request_time": 119,
  "instance_name": "X250",
  "dns_lookup": 9,
  "tcp_connection": 6,
  "tls_handshake": 52,
  "server_processing": 43,
  "content_transfer": 6,
  "timeline": {
    "name_lookup": 9,
    "connect": 16,
    "pretransfer": 68,
    "starttransfer": 112
  },
  "geo": {
    "country": "US",
    "ip": "216.58.209.227"
  },
  "ssl": true,
  "ssl_expiry_date": "2017-07-05T13:28:00Z",
  "ssl_days_left": 74
}
```

* If pattern is not filled `http_body_pattern` is always `true`
* `tls_handshake`, `ssl_expiry_date` and `ssl_days_left` are not shown when `http://` only
* `geo` is omitted if geoip is not set

## Error Handling

beeping returns HTTP 500 when check fail. The body contains the reason of the failure.

```
{
  "message": "Get https://mysite.com/health: net/http: request canceled (Client Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)"
}
```
